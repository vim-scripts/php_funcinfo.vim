A filetype plugin file for PHP. Displays a list of built-in PHP functions, their prototypes and short descriptions.

Intended to be quick-reference-under-hand while editing a PHP script. You hit a hotkey, it opens a list of all PHP functions and displays a short synopsis for the word under cursor, if that is found.

The plugin is =UNFINISHED=, so there are some bugs:
- Some bugs in function list updating. Flicker. And somewhere in moving back-and-forth, wrong entries begin to show up.
- Syntax highlighting of the function prototype is quite messy.
- No mappings to put the selected function call back into the text.
- Speedup might help.

Also planned:
- Parse the XML source of the manual thoroughly, including predefined constants and variables, dividing functions into sections, etc.
- Kind of integration with external help, like Vim format by JÃ¶rn Horstmann (http://planetxml.de/vim-php-manual.php), or HTML format (will probably have to write a Vim browser) or CHM.

Anybody who cares, feel free to take over the development of this plugin.
